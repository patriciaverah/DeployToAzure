In the upper menu, user can find the **Studies and Jobs** page link, where the web shows a list of my education and work experiences. In this page, user can also access an aditional page to add studies or jobs to the database. 

Also in the upper menu, user can find the **Hobbies** page link, where it is shown the contests that I have participated in. I also added some basic hobbies information about myself.
